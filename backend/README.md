# Flask API

This folder contains very basic code that was used to experiment with Plotly on a Flask webserver. Most of the efforts became irrelevant after discovering the possibility of moving everything client-side.

The [chart.json](./chart.json) file is an example of the JSON code generated by the frontend. For inspiration on how to load this JSON into Python, please refer to [this Python example](/frontend/scripts/code.py).

## Setup Instructions

The setup is handled by the `./startup.sh` file. Just run the following in your terminal.

```sh
./startup.sh
```
